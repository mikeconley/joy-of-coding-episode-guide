  - [ ] Clean up the locales report
    - [x] I want to not show rows if there are no missing or pending strings
    - [x] Compute strings that are missing vs pending
    - [x] I want each locale row to tell me how many are missing, and how many are pending
    - [ ] If newtab.ftl in Nightly is newer, I want to link to its revision log
    - [x] "Train-hopping is blocked." is too strong, it _might_ be blocked. It's up to us to decide.
    - [x] When expanded, I want the list to be more readable and maybe to link out to Pontoon for the missing string
    - [x] I want the list of missing / pending strings to be constrained and scrollable
