**Today**

* HTTP code 422
	* ![46337c238a1d97cad68efeb49c7fdb96.png](images/bd6f8274570d4c35a8b34f5871010b55)
* Q: "My release version of private browsing was updated with this about:config variable:
`browser.privatebrowsing.felt-privacy-v1`
I was a little surprised as it isn't default in nightly yet...
Just from looking at Bugzilla it is hard to see initial bugs and what stage feature rollouts and trials are at. 
Can you give some pointers?"
* Let's keep going with the holepunching thing!
	* Tests
		* Tests for the AboutNewTabComponentRegistry
		* Tests for the ExternalComponentsFeed
		* Tests for the ExternalComponentWrapper
		* Test for the search component registration, to make sure it's happening
	* Potentially rename #verifyConfiguration to #validateConfiguration, and have it actually do something (in this case, just make sure another SEARCH component wasn't already registered)
	* Update JSDoc comments
	* [x] Determine if ExternalComponents.refresh is being called at the right time
		* Right now, it seems to be called _too frequently_, and I think we're not using Redux correctly.
	* Think through the error/setError state for ExternalComponentWrapper
	* Add some initial documentation!
* Next week is the last stream for 2025, the "holiday" stream! And then I'm off for 2 weeks for holidays!
* TODO: Find the bug that flips the pref by default, and attach it to this agenda
