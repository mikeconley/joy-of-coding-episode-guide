* Question: Hey Mike, I have a question about a feature you mentioned in episode 393 of TJOC. One of the new things that shipped with Firefox 135.0 were the new AI chatbots, but I'm also aware of a project called Orbit - https://orbitbymozilla.com/ -, which seems to become the official AI assistant of Firefox one day (or that's at least how I understand it). Are both features related to one another, will they be merged or what is the actual difference between these two? Could you explain this a little bit? I tried Orbit and it's an interesting project, but I don't really know if this is just an experiment or if this will actually ship with Firefox itself one day and integrate with the AI chatbots or something like that.
