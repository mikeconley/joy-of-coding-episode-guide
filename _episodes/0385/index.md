## Topics
* Short episode due to network problems
* Q: "why JS and not TS?"
* A:
  - We want the type-safety of TypeScript, without having to rewrite everything. Thankfully, TypeScript (quietly) added support for checking .js files with JSDoc in TypeScript 2.3
  - We already have the JSDoc effort underway - we're working on it right now on this stream!
  - There are XPCOM / WebIDL pieces we need to figure out
  - There is pathing to figure out
  - But this was recently piloted, and logic bugs were found and fixed
