* Update the episode guide
* A lot of permalinks are broken in the episode guide! Not all of them, but a lot of them.
* Shout-out to Canova, who streamed himself hacking on Firefox Profiler things: https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mb-oFRnS0M4
* Advice / tips for people who want to start livehacking (Mozillians or otherwise)
  - Practice. This takes muscle!
    - See if you can do 1 hour, 1.5 hours, and see what it does to your voice. See if you can concentrate and actually do things. Watch the recording afterwards - were there big periods of silence where you were thinking in your head and not speaking?
    - Do a pilot episode and don't make a big deal out of it.
  - Hardware
    - Get a good microphone. A Blue Yeti is a classic USB mic that podcasters use. I'm using a Rode NT-1 with a USB interface. Roland UA-25EX.
    - Get a decent camera - I'm using an OBSBot Tiny.
    - Use OBS and explore. OBS = Open Broadcaster Software
    - Have a separate display for OBS.
  - Turn off notifications on your software when streaming!
  - Shut down non-necessary software that you don't streamed!
  - Have a consistent schedule if you can
  - Reduce how much overhead there is to produce an episode.
* Another moz-cached-ohttp image bug!
