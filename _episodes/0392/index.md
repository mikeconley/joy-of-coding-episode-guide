## Topics
* Vertical tabs stuff!
  - Close buttons on vertical tabs
  - Keyboard shortcut for vertical tabs
    - Ctrl-Z on macOS
    - Alt+Ctrl+Z on Linux and Windows
  - Looks like it might ride out as an option in Firefox 136 (March?): https://bugzilla.mozilla.org/show_bug.cgi?id=1936379
* Continuing to document CustomizableUI!
* What to do for the 400th episode??!
  - Do a SPICY HACKING EPISODE. This is where I work on code while eating very spicy food on a regular interval (10 minutes per wing or something)
  - We can examine some video game source code
  - We could try to fix a Thunderbird bug
  - We could try to fix the oldest possible Firefox bug during the episode (so find a really old bug, try to fix it in a one-shot)
  - Write a simple add-on to do... something
  - Try to do something with AI? How would we feel about that?
    - We could write a tool that tries to pipe the transcript of past episodes into an LLM to produce video title suggestions.
    - Revive Adso, and attempt to hand-roll our own captions using newer models
  - Try to write... something in Rust?... I've done this before, but we could try again. Try to port a JS module to Rust for use with application-services.
